### Description

### Modifying or building the source
This app is built using Grunt. Node.js and Ruby are needed to build this app. Once node is installed, install grunt-cli and bower gobally using npm. Next, you'll need to install the dev dependencies and vendor scripts for the build file by running `npm install && bower install` from the root of the apps directory. Once installed, you can run the grunt build with the `grunt` command. Modify the source, and grunt should rebuild it. Enjoy!
